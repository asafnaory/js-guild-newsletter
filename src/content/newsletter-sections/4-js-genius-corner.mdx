Ever wondered why TypeScript has a never type? It turns out to be quite useful!

The never type can help create exhaustive dependencies. For example:

```typescript

    type Shape = Circle | Square;

    interface Circle {
        kind: "circle";
        radius: number;
    }

    interface Square {
        kind: "square";
        sideLength: number;
    }

    function calculateArea(shape: Shape): number | void {
        if(shape.kind === 'circle'){
            return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
        }
        else if (shape.kind === 'square'){ 
            return shape.sideLength ** 2;
        }
        else {
            // Forces a TypeScript error if a new shape is added without updating this function 
            const exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
            return exhaustiveCheck;
        }
    }

```
Now, if someone adds a new shape type to Shape, they'll encounter an error in the else clause, promoting comprehensive function updates.
