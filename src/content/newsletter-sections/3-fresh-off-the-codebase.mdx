As you might already be aware, our site has launched a [new juniors program]('https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7182994708091060225/').
In this week's guild session, we delved into creating the optimal technical onboarding program by focusing on teaching some key frontend and Node.js technologies. Think you can contribute? Join us!
